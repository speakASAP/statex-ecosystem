# Repository Agent Instructions

Shared rules live here:

- Codex profile: `/home/ssf/.codex/AGENTS.md`
- Cross-agent standard: `/home/ssf/.ai-agent-standards/CROSS_AGENT_AUTOMATION_STANDARD.md`
- Repository operations: `AGENT_OPERATIONS.md`

Read those first, then follow the repository-specific notes below and the current planning/status files.


## Repository-Specific Notes

<!-- BEGIN:nextjs-agent-rules -->
# This is NOT the Next.js you know

## Knowledge Retrieval

Use `docs-rag-microservice` for bounded discovery when it is healthy, then
verify deployment, security, database, integration and public-contract facts
against the cited Git source. Git remains authoritative.

Authority and fallback rules:
`/home/ssf/Documents/Github/shared/docs/DOCUMENTATION_AUTHORITY.md`.

Do not generate tokens in documentation or assume an unconfident/failed RAG
response means that source documentation does not exist.

## Project docs

- `BUSINESS.md`, `SYSTEM.md`, `TASKS.md`, `STATE.json`
